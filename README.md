# Constructor-Word-Guess

## This project is a Homework assignment for a Coding Bootcamp

### About the Code

* This is a **Command Line** app.
* **Javascript** is the main language used for coding.
* I have used **Constructor Functions** and **Prototypal Inheritance** to connect the various objects in the code.
* [npm inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) is used for asking questions in the command line.

### Things to do before you clone/download

* If you plan to clone this app then make sure you have the current/recommended version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your computer.
* You will need to run `npm init -y` in your terminal to install the `package.json` file
* Then run `npm install inquirer` to install the [npm inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) which is the core of this app.

### Part One Shapes

* The part one logs the name, area, perimeter and number of sides of a square and rectangle in the terminal.

### Part Two Survivor-Monster

* The app prompts you to guess a number between 1 and 30.
* If your guess matches the pre-selected number by the app then, you win the game.
* If your guess is wrong then you are attacked by a monster and you are notified of your loss of health which is equal to the attack power of the monster.
* If your health goes below 0 then you lose the game.
